Session Tab Overhaul
===========================

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that overhauls the Session Tab of the Dash, most notably the Users list, by adding more details and options. 

Adds the following features to the Users list:
* Alternating background colors for the rows
* FPS or queued packets (when above 10) label
* Desktop, VR, or Headless icon
* Host name can be tinted with the host icon's color
* Clicking on a username will open the user in the contacts tab
* Badges in a separate column
* Local volume slider handle colored according to voice mode
* Voice mode icon (click to reset local volume to 100%)
* Bring button as the opposite of Jump (requires respawn permission to use)
* Steam button linking to the User's steam profile if available

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [SessionTabOverhaul.dll](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosSessionTabOverhaul/releases/latest/download/SessionTabOverhaul.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
